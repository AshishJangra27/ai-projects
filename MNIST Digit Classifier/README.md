This project demonstrates handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.  
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits with high accuracy.

## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import the MNIST dataset from Keras.  
2. Preprocessing – Normalize image data and prepare labels.  
3. Model Building – Build a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
4. Training – Train the model and tune hyperparameters.  
5. Evaluation – Measure accuracy and performance on the test dataset.  
6. Visualization – Plot training metrics and sample predictions.
