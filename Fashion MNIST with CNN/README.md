# Fashion-MNIST Classification with CNN

A simple notebook to classify Fashion-MNIST images using deep learning models.  
Covers dataset setup, model building, and training with performance monitoring.  

**Steps:**
1. Dataset preparation (load, normalize, reshape, encode)  
2. Build models: ANN, Basic CNN, Deeper CNN  
3. Train models with callbacks for optimization  
4. Evaluate and compare model performance
