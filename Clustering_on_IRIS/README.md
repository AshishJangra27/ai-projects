[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/149-fnafykb9Y7V86NjeELow1Vs7CmDcm?usp=sharing)

This project demonstrates clustering techniques on the Iris dataset.  
It applies unsupervised learning algorithms to group similar data points and visualize patterns.

## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import the Iris dataset from sklearn or other sources.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis – Summarize and visualize data features.  
3. Preprocessing – Standardize or normalize features for clustering.  
4. Clustering – Apply algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.  
5. Evaluation – Use metrics such as the silhouette score to measure clustering quality.  
6. Visualization – Plot clusters for better understanding.
