This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
It applies basic preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques for image recognition tasks.

## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import the CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras.  
2. Preprocessing – Normalize image data and prepare labels.  
3. Model Building – Build a CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.  
4. Training – Train the model with chosen optimizer and loss function.  
5. Evaluation – Measure accuracy and performance on test data.  
6. Visualization – Plot training history and sample predictions.
