[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qmqKQGatkZ9UA7HV1RCE-EmeC5bBGwwc?usp=sharing)

This project demonstrates gender style transfer using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
It focuses on applying deep learning to modify facial attributes while preserving identity.

## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import and preprocess a facial dataset.  
2. Preprocessing – Resize, normalize, and prepare images for training.  
3. Model Building – Design a GAN or use a pre-trained model for style transfer.  
4. Training – Train the GAN to modify gender-specific features.  
5. Inference – Generate new images with gender style changes.  
6. Evaluation – Analyze visual quality and effectiveness of transformations.
