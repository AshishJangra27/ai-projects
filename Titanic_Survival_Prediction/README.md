## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or other sources.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualize and analyze key features.  
3. Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.  
4. Model Building – Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others.  
5. Evaluation – Assess model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.  
6. Insights – Interpret key findings and survival factors.
