## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import Fashion MNIST dataset from keras or other sources.  
2. Preprocessing – Flatten and normalize images.  
3. Dimensionality Reduction – Apply methods like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP.  
4. Visualization – Plot the dataset in 2D space to analyze grouping and separation of classes.  
5. Insights – Interpret visual patterns for potential applications.
