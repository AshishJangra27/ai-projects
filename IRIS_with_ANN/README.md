This project demonstrates classification of the Iris dataset using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  
It showcases how deep learning can effectively classify small, structured datasets.

## Workflow
1. Data Loading – Import the Iris dataset from sklearn or other sources.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis – Summarize and visualize feature distributions.  
3. Preprocessing – Encode labels and scale features.  
4. Model Building – Design a simple ANN with dense layers.  
5. Training – Train the network and tune hyperparameters.  
6. Evaluation – Analyze accuracy and performance metrics.
